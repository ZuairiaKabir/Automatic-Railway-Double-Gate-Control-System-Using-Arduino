# Automatic-Railway-Double-Gate-Control-System-Using-Arduino
An Arduino-based automated railway level-crossing gate control system designed to reduce accidents, minimize human error, and improve efficiency at railway crossings. This project uses ultrasonic sensors and servo motors to detect an approaching train and automatically open/close two railway gates for enhanced safety.
